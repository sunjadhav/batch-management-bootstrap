# batch-management-bootstrap
Batch Management System manages and maintains a list of batches and students. The organization maintains batch and student records in excel or notebook, but it's a very old method of maintaining the records, hence I introduced the application which can maintain the records with all the details and payment collection as well wherein you can download the CSV or pdf file anytime you want. Application has one scheduler which can be used to back up your data.  Implementation Technologies: Java, Spring MVC, Thymeleaf, Spring Boot, Hibernate, JPA, MYSQL, Maven.
